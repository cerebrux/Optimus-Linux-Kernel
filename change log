Package: version v03
	Total rebuild from scratch using Official Ubuntu Kernels and then patch it with BFS
and BFQ patches instead of using Zen kernel.

	Note: in future this repository will be obsolete due to my intantion to create my
	own cutom builds and not zen kernels

	--Now compatible with intel and AMD 64bit CPUs
